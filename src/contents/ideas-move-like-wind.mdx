{/* # Ideas Move Like Wind */}

I used to think an idea was mine — that I originated it, discovered it, claimed it.

But the more I build, the more I observe, the more I realize:  
**Ideas aren’t owned. They’re tuned into.**

Somewhere in this universe, someone else was thinking the same thing.  
Not because we copied each other, but because we were on the same frequency —  
tuned into the same problem, the same feeling, the same need for change.

**An idea is like wind.**

It flows freely through space and time. It doesn’t belong to anyone.  
You don’t create wind — you feel it, you capture it, you try to give it form before it moves on.

So when an idea comes to me, I don’t call it mine.  
I call it something I was ready to receive.  
And I try to honour it — by building it with care, without ego, and without the illusion of originality.

Because originality isn’t about ownership.  
It’s about how you **listen**.
